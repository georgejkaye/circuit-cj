# `examples` package

This package contains examples of what one can do with the system.
Currently there aren't many but hopefully this can change in time!
These examples will also need to be documented.

## Examples

### [`accumulator.cj`](accumulator.cj)

A slightly more involved example, showing how delay and feedback can be implemented.

### [`half-adder.cj`](half-adder.cj)

A very basic example: a half adder.
Defined in combinator style and functional style, to illustrate the differences between them.

### [`serial-multiplier.cj`](serial-multiplier.cj)

A more complex example, combining lots of features such as registers, feedback, and parameterising circuits.

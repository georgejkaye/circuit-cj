# A hardware design language for Cangjie

This repo contains a library for designing hardware in Cangjie. In particular, we want to be able to perform the following things:

- Design
- Simulation/Reduction
- Synthesis
- Verification

For more documentation see the [wiki](https://gitlab-uk.rnd.huawei.com/cpl_uk_team/circuits-cj/-/wikis/home).

## Compiling

The library compiles with Cangjie version `0.33.4`.

```
cpm build
```

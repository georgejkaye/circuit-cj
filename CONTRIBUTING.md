## Gitee issue tags

Gitee (as far as I know) doesn't let you make your own issue tags, so I have
picked ones that are vaguely thematically linked.

* **Bug:** Issues caused by bugs in the library
* **FeatureRequest:** Issues or suggestions for new functionality
* **UI:** Issues with how the user interacts with the library
* **Footprint:** Issues with code smells or refactoring
* **Discussion:** Issues with the documentation
